Amortized Analysis:
- A bad one today but next one will beocme good becuase of this
- Like QuickFind may be take O(logN) with path compression but next one will become better
- Dynamic array is also amortized O(1), which when exhausted takes O(N) but only once in a while
- Different from QuickSort random where worst case is O(n^2), average is O(NlgN) but one run doesn't 
  improve next one as it is random

Invariant:
- A fact about a data structure that is always true

- Not every class is ADTs. Some classes just store data (no invariants)
