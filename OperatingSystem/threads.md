Simultaneous Multithreading/Hyperthreading
- Hardware technique
  > Superscalar processors can execute multiple instructions that are independent
  > Hyperthreading duplicates register state to make a second thread, allowing more
    instructions to run.
Address Mapping:
- Virtual Address -> Physical Address
